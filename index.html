        premium tax credit across all enrollees was $527/month in 2023, with an
        average monthly premium of $123.69. Results vary based on a number of
        factors, including age, income, family size, health history, cost of
        available insurance coverage, where you live, and more. You are not
        eligible for the premium tax credit for coverage purchased outside the
        marketplace. Our goal is to provide exceptional service. One of our
        agents may reach out to you to discuss your order, ask for feedback,
        and/or see if you need any assistance with your products, services, or
        plans, at the phone number you provided regardless of your do-not-call
        list status. You may opt-out of further contact at any time by simply
        telling our customer service team that you would no longer like to be
        contacted. In the event that our team is unable to reach you by phone,
        they may send you a text message letting you know that we called. Both
        our text messages and phone calls may be sent or connected utilizing
        automated software. Carrier charges may apply. You may opt-out of any
        future contact via text message by replying anytime with "STOP".
